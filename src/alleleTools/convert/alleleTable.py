    """
    A standardized data structure for storing allele data with metadata.

    This class provides a unified interface for handling allele data from
    polymorphic genes, along with associated phenotype and covariate information.
    It serves as the core data structure for allele analysis workflows.

    Attributes:
        alleles (pd.DataFrame): Main allele data with samples as rows and
           genes/alleles as columns
        phenotype (pd.Series): Phenotype information indexed by sample ID
        covariates (pd.DataFrame): Covariate data with samples as rows and
          covariates as columns

    Example:
        >>> table = AlleleTable()
        >>> # Load allele data
        >>> table.alleles = pd.DataFrame(...)
        >>> # Add phenotype information
        >>> table.phenotype = pd.Series(...)
